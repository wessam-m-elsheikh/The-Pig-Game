# The-Pig-Game
It's a dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points first.
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either:
rolls a 1 : the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
rolls 2 - 6 : the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
presses hold: The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
it's a two-player game, or you can play against yourself.
The brighter background indicates the active player so it's your turn to roll the dice.
the darker background indicates the inactive player.
